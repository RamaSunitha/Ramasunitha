Hello and welcome! ðŸ˜Š

Iâ€™m Rama Sunitha, a 2024 graduate with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I am passionate about software development and have been trained in Java Full Stack Development. I am excited to begin my career in the tech industry and contribute to building innovative software solutions.

During my training, I have gained hands-on experience with Java, Spring Boot, Angular, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and databases, which has equipped me with the skills needed to develop end-to-end solutions. I also have a keen interest in problem-solving skills.
